# Company Size Gap Analysis Explained

## DATA: How We Calculated the 39.5% Company Size Gap

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

#### **1. Data Loading & Preparation**
- **Source**: Lightcast job postings dataset (`data/raw/lightcast_job_postings.csv`)
- **Total Records**: 72,498 job postings
- **After Salary Cleaning**: 32,398 job postings (removed entries without salary data)
- **Unique Companies**: 5,995 different organizations

#### **2. Company Size Classification Method**

We used **job posting volume** as a proxy for company size:

```python
# Count job postings per company
company_counts = df.groupby('COMPANY_NAME').size().reset_index(name='job_count')

# Create size categories using tertiles (3 groups)
df['Company_Size'] = pd.qcut(df['job_count'], 3, 
                            labels=['Small', 'Medium', 'Large'], 
                            duplicates='drop')
```

**Company Size Breakdown:**

- **Small Companies**: 1-12 job postings (median: 3 postings)
- **Medium Companies**: 13-146 job postings (median: 49 postings)  
- **Large Companies**: 161-2,146 job postings (median: 1,436 postings)

#### **3. Top Companies by Job Posting Volume**

1. **Deloitte**: 2,146 job postings
2. **Unclassified**: 1,807 job postings
3. **Accenture**: 1,436 job postings
4. **Humana**: 402 job postings
5. **Lumen Technologies**: 395 job postings

#### **4. Salary Analysis by Company Size**

| Company Size | Average Salary | Median Salary | Job Count | Std Deviation |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Small**    | $113,915      | $105,986      | 11,048    | $55,667       |
| **Medium**   | $136,016      | $131,600      | 10,574    | $56,795       |
| **Large**    | $158,967      | $163,822      | 10,776    | $61,631       |

#### **5. Gap Calculation Formula**

```
Company Size Gap = ((Highest Salary - Lowest Salary) / Lowest Salary) × 100

Gap = (($158,967 - $113,915) / $113,915) × 100 = 39.5%
```

### **Why This Matters**

1. **$45,052 Average Difference**: Large companies pay significantly more than small companies
2. **Progressive Scale**: Medium companies fall between small and large ($136,016 average)
3. **Market Power**: Larger companies can offer higher compensation due to resources and scale
4. **Career Strategy**: Job seekers should consider company size when evaluating opportunities
