## Data Sources

### Primary Dataset
**Lightcast Job Postings Analytics**
- **Sample Size**: 500,000+ job postings
- **Time Period**: January 2024 - September 2025
- **Geographic Coverage**: United States and Canada  
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly refreshes

### Data Fields
- Job identifiers and metadata
- Salary ranges (minimum, maximum, average)
- Geographic location information
- Industry and company classifications
- Required skills and qualifications
- Experience level requirements
- Remote work indicators

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Remove duplicate job postings
- Standardize salary information
- Validate geographic locations
- Clean and categorize job titles

### 2. Feature Engineering  
- Calculate average salaries from ranges
- Extract experience years from levels
- Classify AI-related roles using keyword matching
- Identify remote work opportunities
- Geographic standardization (city, state, region)

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Remove outlier salaries (< $20k, > $500k)
- Validate location mappings
- Check for missing critical data
- Ensure consistent categorizations

## Analysis Methodology

### Statistical Approaches
- **Descriptive statistics** for salary distributions
- **Regression analysis** for factor importance
- **Geographic clustering** for regional patterns
- **Time series analysis** for trend identification

### Categorization Logic
**AI-Related Roles**: Jobs with titles or skills containing:
- Machine learning, artificial intelligence, AI, ML
- Deep learning, neural networks, computer vision
- Natural language processing, data science
- Related algorithm and framework keywords

**Experience Levels**: Mapped to years:
- Entry Level: 0-2 years
- Mid Level: 3-7 years  
- Senior Level: 8-15 years
- Executive: 15+ years

### Limitations and Considerations
- Job posting data may not reflect all market activity
- Salary ranges may be estimates or outdated
- Geographic classifications based on posted locations
- Skills requirements may be aspirational vs. mandatory
- Sample bias toward larger companies and online postings

## Validation and Cross-Checking
- Bureau of Labor Statistics comparison
- Industry salary survey benchmarking  
- Geographic cost-of-living adjustments
- Peer review of categorization logic
